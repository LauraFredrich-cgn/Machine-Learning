You will classify movie reviews into \"positive\" reviews and \"negative\" reviews, just based on the text content of the reviews.\n","\n","The **IMDB** dataset is a set of 50.000 highly-polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. They are split into 25.000 reviews for training and 25.000 reviews for testing, each set consisting in 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.\n","The IMDB dataset comes packaged with Keras.
