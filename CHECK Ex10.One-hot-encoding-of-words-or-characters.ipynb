It was used in the previous IMDB and Reuters classification examples and in both cases it was done with entire words. \n","One-hot encoding is fairly simple and consists in associating a unique integer index to every word, then turning this integer index i into a binary vector of size N, which is the size of the vocabulary, that would be all-zeros except for the i-th entry, which would be 1. \n","\n","Of course, one-hot encoding can be done on character level as well. This exercise shows how one-hot encoding is implemented and this is what you will learn. So, here are examples of one-hot encoding: one for words, the other for characters. The third example shows how to implement this not from scrach, but using the built-in utilities in Keras.\n","\n","-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","### <font color=\"FFC300\">TASKS</font>:\n","The tasks that you need to work on in this notebook are always indicated below as bullet points. \n","If a task is more challenging and consists of several steps, this is indicated as well. \n","Make sure you have worked down the task list and commented your doings. \n","This should be done by using markdown.<br> \n","<font color=red>Make sure you don't forget to specify your name and your matriculation number in the notebook before submitting it.</font>\n","\n","**YOUR TASKS in this exercise are as follows**:\n","1. import the notebook to Google Colab.\n","2. make sure you specified you name and your matriculation number in the header below my name and date. \n","    * set the date too and remove mine.\n","3. read the entire notebook carefully. \n","    * add comments whereever you feel it necessary for better understanding.\n","    * run the notebook and try to follow and understand all steps and examples.\n","4. the exercise in this notebook contains one single implementational task. \n","    * implement a one-hot encoding on character level using Keras' built-in functions. \n","    * let yourself be guided from the other three examples in this notebook. \n","   \n","-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EODqVKhtcwzv"},"source":["# START OF THE NOTEBOOK CODE\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wAgit9cTcwzw"},"source":["## <font color=\"#C70039\">EXAMPLE I</font>\n","## Word level one-hot encoding example"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FF9V9bZkcwzw"},"source":["### necessary imports\n","others are going to be included as soon as they are needed"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"J6huyhzrcwzx","outputId":"8497da7b-c283-43b1-8f08-80210684c59d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1673862808236,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":343,"user":{"displayName":"Laura Fredrich","userId":"17017899409858020778"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'2.9.0'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}],"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","tf.keras.__version__"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l0x7MX0Icwzy"},"source":["This is the initial data.
