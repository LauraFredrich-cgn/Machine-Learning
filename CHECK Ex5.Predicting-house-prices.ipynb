As you have learned already, another common type of machine learning problem is *regression*, which consists of predicting a continuous value instead of a discrete label. \n","For instance, predicting the temperature tomorrow, given meteorological data, or predicting the time that a \n","software project will take to complete, given its specifications. \n","Make sure, you do not mix up \"regression\" with the algorithm \"logistic regression\": confusingly, \"logistic regression\" is not a regression algorithm, it is a classification algorithm. :-)\n","\n","This notebook allows you for predict the median price of homes in a given Boston suburb in the mid-1970s, given a few data points about the suburb at the time, such as the crime rate, the local property tax rate, etc.\n","The dataset we will be using has another interesting difference from our two previous examples: it has very few data points, only 506 in total, split between 404 training samples and 102 test samples, and each \"feature\" in the input data (e.g. the crime rate is a feature) has a different scale. For instance some values are proportions, which take a values between 0 and 1, others take values between 1 and 12, others between 0 and 100...\n","\n","-----------------------\n","### <font color=\"FFC300\">TASKS</font>:\n","Within this notebook, the tasks that you need to work on are always listed as bullet points below. \n","If a task is more challenging and consists of several steps, this is indicated as well. \n","Make sure you have worked down the task list and commented your doings. \n","This should be done using markdown.<br> \n","<font color=red>Make sure you don't forget to specify your name and your matriculation number in the notebook before submitting it.</font>\n","\n","**YOUR TASKS in this exercise are as follows**:\n","1. import the notebook to Google Colab.\n","2. make sure you specified you name and your matriculation number in the header below my name and date.\n","    * set the date too and remove mine.\n","3. read the entire notebook carefully\n","    * for better understanding, add comments whereever you feel it necessary \n","    * run the notebook for the first time and note the result in your markdown result table (your test plan). \n","4. go into the section 'building the ANN'. \n","    * add the missing code that does create a network as shown in the image in the lecture slides on page 179 (File: 'DIS21a.1-7.HANDS_ON.First.DLNetwork.Architectures.for.Solving.Three.Interesting.Problems.pdf')\n","    * set the activation function to ReLu\n","    * set the correct activation function in the last layer/the output.
